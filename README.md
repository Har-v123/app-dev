# My Favorite Series and Movies

| My Ranking | Series | Description | Seasons |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| ðŸ¥ˆ 2nd |  **1. The Boys** | One of the best series in Amazon, I love this series because Superheroes are often as popular as celebrities, and as influential as politicians. But in this series, they are depicted the opposite.| 3 Seasons |
| ðŸ¥‰ 3rd | **2. Peaky Blinders** | Britain is a mixture of despair and hedonism in 1919 in the aftermath of the Great War. I love this series mainly because of its grim plot and atmosphere. | 7 Seasons |
| ðŸ¥‡ 1st | **3. Rick and Morty** |  The misadventures of Rick Sanchez, a cynical mad scientist, and his good-hearted but fretful grandson Morty Smith, who split their time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures that take place across an infinite number of realities | 7 Seasons |
